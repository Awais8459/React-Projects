# React Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository containing various React projects! In this repository, you will find three different applications: a Movie Search App, an E-commerce App, and a Weather App. Each application is built using React.js and incorporates additional technologies and APIs to provide unique functionality.

## Movie Search App
The Movie Search App allows users to search for movies and retrieve detailed information about them. It utilizes React.js, Axios, and the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API to fetch movie data. The app is styled using HTML and CSS to provide an appealing user interface.

To run the Movie Search App locally, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the Movie Search App directory.
4. Install the project dependencies by running `npm install`.
5. Start the development server by running `npm start`.
6. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the app.

## E-commerce App
The E-commerce App is a simple online shopping platform that fetches product data from the FakeStore API. It leverages React.js, Axios, and HTML/CSS to create a dynamic and interactive shopping experience.

To run the E-commerce App locally, please follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the E-commerce App directory.
4. Install the project dependencies by running `npm install`.
5. Start the development server by running `npm start`.
6. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the app.

## Weather App
The Weather App allows users to search for weather information for a specific location. It utilizes React.js, Axios, and the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data. The app is styled using HTML and CSS, providing a clean and intuitive interface.

To run the Weather App locally, please follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the Weather App directory.
4. Install the project dependencies by running `npm install`.
5. Start the development server by running `npm start`.
6. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the app.

## CRUD Task To-Do App

This repository contains a CRUD Task To-Do application built with Node.js, Express.js, React.js, and MongoDB. The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks efficiently. 

To set up the backend:
1. Install Node.js and MongoDB on your system.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the backend directory.
3. Install the dependencies using npm.
4. Configure the MongoDB connection in the `config.js` file.
5. Run the server using the command `npm start`.

To set up the frontend:
1. Navigate to the frontend directory.
2. Install the dependencies using npm.
3. Configure the API endpoint in the `config.js` file.
4. Run the frontend using the command `npm start`.

This CRUD Task To-Do App provides a user-friendly interface and effective task management capabilities. Use this project as a starting point and customize it according to your specific requirements.

Please note that for the Weather App, you may need to create a `.env` file and provide the necessary API key from OpenWeather. However, in this repository, the `.env` file has not been included.

Feel free to explore the source code of each application, modify them, and use them as learning resources. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out. Enjoy!
