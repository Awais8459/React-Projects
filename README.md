# My React Projects Repository

Welcome to my React Projects repository! This repository contains three exciting projects built using React: a Movie Search App, an E-commerce App, and a Weather App. Each project provides a unique and interactive user experience, showcasing different aspects of React's capabilities.

## Projects Included

### 1. Movie Search App

The Movie Search App is a web application that allows users to search for movies and get detailed information about them. Users can search for movies by title, and the app fetches data from a movie database API to display relevant movie details such as the title, release date, plot summary, and ratings. The Movie Search App is designed to help movie enthusiasts find information about their favorite movies quickly and easily.

### 2. E-commerce App

The E-commerce App is a fully functional online shopping application. It provides users with an intuitive and visually appealing interface to browse through a catalog of products, add items to the cart, and proceed to the checkout process. The app includes features such as product filtering, sorting, and a responsive design for optimal user experience across devices. With the E-commerce App, users can enjoy a seamless and enjoyable online shopping experience.

### 3. Weather App

The Weather App is a handy tool for checking current weather conditions and forecasts for different locations. Users can enter a city or location, and the app fetches weather data from a weather API to display information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. The Weather App offers a clean and intuitive interface, providing users with up-to-date weather information at their fingertips.
